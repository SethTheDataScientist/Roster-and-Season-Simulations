# Roster-and-Season-Simulations
This is a collection of simulations I have created in the past based on different methods of predicting an NFL season. 
This goes as far back as 2019 when I was working on a Monte Carlo Simulation for the entire season using Points per Gamne and Points allowed per game through more recent attempts using the season simluator from the nflverse.
